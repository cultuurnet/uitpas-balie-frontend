/**
 * Grouppass is a special kind of UiTPAS concept: it has an `uitpasNumber` like regular passholders, but it can only participate in ticket sale flows (either social tariff or using coupons). 

The social tariff for grouppasses is a little bit different from regular passholders, because a grouppass is entitled to buy a certain amount of `totalTicketsPerYear`, of which the remaining amount is indicated by `availableTickets`.

A grouppass cannot check-in at events, or redeem rewards.

A `Grouppass` can be identified by its `id`. However, there are cases where the grouppass is identified using its UiTPAS number. Every grouppass has one (and only one) uitpas number.
